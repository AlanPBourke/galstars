# galstars

**galstars.bas** - XC=Basic v2.1 version  
**galstarsv3.bas** - XC=Basic V3.1 version

This is a conversion of Jason Aldred's Galencia starfield, taken from his
game of the same name. Jason extracted the starfield ASM code into a standalone
programme (see link below), and this is an XC-BASIC recreation of that.

I wanted to see if an XC-BASIC version could approach the speed of the ASM and 
in an eyeball test at least, it does. I've commented the code quite heavily to 
maybe help other people in tasks like redefining the char set and so on.

I briefly worked in the same dev house as Jason in the early 90s, and he was
always ready to help other coders. I know he's had his health problems so if he 
ever reads this, I hope he's OK.
